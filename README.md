Software Engineering Class Project
Team : Nahla Al Hamad, Can Xu, Janeel Shah, and Dharmay Prajapati.
This project is about real estate agents, who can register through our website and create accounts,
then insert their properties and all details about each one, update and delete properties as needed.
Users and agents can register and login to their accounts.
Agents can obtain a brief report regarding how many properties they have sold or rented.
A user can search for a house or apartment by inserting the city and state, then they will see all the results related to their search,
then they can further refine their search, like configurations, price ranges, and mortgage ranges, to narrow their results and make their search easier. 
The user can see all the search results and click on more details link to see more information about specific property. After logging in,
the user can add the property to their like list, as well as contact the agent for more information.
User can navigate their like list and delete any property from their like list.
